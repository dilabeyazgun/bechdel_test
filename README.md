# female_representation_movies_dsa210_termproj
**Introduction**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Motivation**

As a cinephile, i believe that movies connect people from different backgrounds and let us in to worlds we normally would not even imagine to enter. That is why representations in movies are really important. My main motivation for choosing this topic, was to dive into an interest area of mine which is movies. With the aim to analyse them methodologically for the "accurate" representation of women in movies. 


**Abstract**

This DSA210 project's aims is to analyze female representation in the film industry using the dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains data on gender representation in movies. The study will explore how female representation has evolved over time and how it correlates with key factors such as genre, budget, box office revenue, and production trends.Also, will highlight possible biases and structural trends within the film industry. Using Python, the project will involve data extraction, preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization.

**Project Proposal**

This project seeks to examine trends and patterns related to female representation in films. Which will lead us to databased findings and will provide insights into gender disparities in cinema and their potential impact on the industry. 


**Dataset Insight**

The dataset will be sourced from Kaggle’s Female Representation in Cinema dataset. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinifm/female-representation-in-cinema)

It includes data points such as:

-Movie title and release year

-Movie genre

-Production budget

-Box office revenue

-Bechedel test result

    Bechdel test is a measure of the representation of women in film and other fiction. The usual criteria of the Bechdel Test:

    (1) at least two women are featured in the fiction
 
    (2) that these women talk to each other

    (3) that they discuss something other than a man.


**Hypothesis**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: There is a significant correlation between female representation in movies and key industry factors. Higher female representation may be associated with differences in budget allocations, revenue performance, or variations across genres and time periods.



**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: There is no significant correlation between the percentage of female representation in movies and key industry factors such as budget, box office revenue, genre, and year of release. 



**Road Map**
---------------------------------------------------
**Analysis Plan**

I will look out for corelations for the following:

-Year vs. Female Representation: Examining how female representation has changed over time.

-Budget vs. Female Representation: Analyzing whether movies with higher female representation receive similar or different budget allocations compared to male-dominated films.

-Box Office Performance vs. Female Representation: Evaluating if female-led films perform differently in terms of revenue.

-Genre vs. Female Representation: Identifying whether specific genres have higher or lower female representation.


**Implementation Plan**

-Extract and clean data from the Kaggle dataset.

-In case of new or additional data, also implement them accordingly.

-Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends.

-Conduct statistical correlation analysis to examine relationships between female representation and key industry metrics.

-Visualize findings using data visualization techniques.

-Interpret results and discuss implications.

**Expected Outcome**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project will decode the narrative of female representation in cinema through data, uncovering its interplay with budget, revenue, genre, and time. The findings will illuminate industry patterns, challenging biases and shaping a data-driven perspective on storytelling and inclusivity in film.

**Final Outcome** 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As of the end of my project i have gained an insight about bechedel test and the relationship with the parameters such as genres, movie production dates etc.
This project aims us to gain expereince with machine learning methods which i think i did at the end of the porject. I have gained hands on experience with analysing data, making regression graphs, practiced classification etc. As my hypothesis supposes: Higher female representation may be associated with differences in budget allocations, revenue performance, or variations across genres and time periods. I have proven that higher female representation, higher scores in bechedel test have a relation with genres, time periods. Yet, there is not a significant revenue performance and budget allocation with bechedel score

**More Details**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the time period i have analyized 1915-1945 , 1945-1970 , 1970-2005 with 30 year time period which i have founded significant. 1915 marks the first year of WW1, 1945 marks the starting time of WW2. Since USA, UK and France is the top 3 countries where the movies, i did graphs of them. As seen on the graphs, during and after the WW2 epriod (1945-1970) there is a slow down and even a regression in the bechedel score even clearer than the first period (1915-1945). This indicates that during the war times, and after periods women representation in movies decreases.

For the budget distribution, as also seen in the graph there is not a clear distinction with bechedel score increase or decrease. So there does not exist a corelation.

When we observe the genres, which i did top 10 to read more clearly, we can say that there is a relation with genres and bechedel score. Drama and comedy movies have a tendancy to score higher.

There also does not exist a relation with the box office, score in public with the bechedel score.

**Motivation**

As a cinephile, i believe that movies connect people from different backgrounds and let us in to worlds we normally would not even imagine to enter. That is why representations in movies are really important. My main motivation for choosing this topic, was to dive into an area of interest which is movies. With the aim to analyse them methodologically for the "accurate" representation of women in movies. 

**Abstract**

This DSA210 project's aims is to analyze female representation in the film industry using the dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains data on gender representation in movies. The study will explore how female representation has evolved over time and how it correlates with key factors such as genre, budget, box office revenue, and production trends. Using Python, the project will involve data extraction, preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization. The findings will provide insights into gender disparities in cinema and their potential impact on the industry.


**Dataset Insight**

Bechdel test is a measure of the representation of women in film and other fiction. The usual criteria of the Bechdel Test:

(1) at least two women are featured in the fiction

(2) that these women talk to each other

(3) that they discuss something other than a man.

**Introduction**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Motivation**

As a cinephile, i believe that movies connect people from different backgrounds and let us in to worlds we normally would not even imagine to enter. That is why representations in movies are really important. My main motivation for choosing this topic, was to dive into an area of interest which is movies. With the aim to analyse them methodologically for the "accurate" representation of women in movies. 
**Abstract**

This DSA210 project's aims is to analyze female representation in the film industry using the dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains data on gender representation in movies. The study will explore how female representation has evolved over time and how it correlates with key factors such as genre, budget, box office revenue, and production trends.Also, will highlight possible biases and structural trends within the film industry. Using Python, the project will involve data extraction, preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization. The findings will provide insights into gender disparities in cinema and their potential impact on the industry. 


**Dataset Insight**

The dataset will be sourced from Kaggle’s Female Representation in Cinema dataset. It includes data points such as:

-Movie title and release year

-Movie genre

-Production budget

-Box office revenue

-Bechedel test result

    Bechdel test is a measure of the representation of women in film and other fiction. The usual criteria of the Bechdel Test:

    (1) at least two women are featured in the fiction
 
    (2) that these women talk to each other

    (3) that they discuss something other than a man.


**Hypothesis**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: There is a significant correlation between female representation in movies and key industry factors. Higher female representation may be associated with differences in budget allocations, revenue performance, or variations across genres and time periods.



**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: There is no significant correlation between the percentage of female representation in movies and key industry factors such as budget, box office revenue, genre, and year of release. 



**Road Map**
---------------------------------------------------
**Analysis Plan**

I will look out for corelations for the following:
Year vs. Female Representation: Examining how female representation has changed over time.

Budget vs. Female Representation: Analyzing whether movies with higher female representation receive similar or different budget allocations compared to male-dominated films.

Box Office Performance vs. Female Representation: Evaluating if female-led films perform differently in terms of revenue.

Genre vs. Female Representation: Identifying whether specific genres have higher or lower female representation.


**Implementation Plan**

-Extract and clean data from the Kaggle dataset.
-In case of new or additional data, also implement them accordingly.
-Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends.
-Conduct statistical correlation analysis to examine relationships between female representation and key industry metrics.
-Visualize findings using data visualization techniques.
-Interpret results and discuss implications.

**Expected Outcome**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project will decode the narrative of female representation in cinema through data, uncovering its interplay with budget, revenue, genre, and time. The findings will illuminate industry patterns, challenging biases and shaping a data-driven perspective on storytelling and inclusivity in film.

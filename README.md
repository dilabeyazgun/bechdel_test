**Introduction**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bechdel test is a measure of the representation of women in film and other fiction. The usual criteria of the Bechdel Test:

(1) at least two women are featured in the fiction

(2) that these women talk to each other

(3) that they discuss something other than a man.


**Motivation**

As a cinephile, i believe that movies connect people from different backgrounds and let us in to worlds we normally would not even imagine to enter. That is why representations in movies are really important. My main motivation for choosing this topic, was to dive into an area of interest which is movies. Analyse methodologically the "accurate" representation of women in movies.

Project description for the second phase: 

-collect the data
-conduct exploratory data analysis methods 
-hypothesis tests on the data 

During this phase of the project, firstly i had to deal organising data from :
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinifm/female-representation-in-cinema?resource=download
The dataset that i had chosen was very large, was not in a good form in order to analyse and
make assumptions with a lot of unrelated lines that needed normalising.

Secondly, for the conducting data analysis part.
In this part i plotted graphs, played with my large dataset over 7000 movies. Asked different questions to and 
tried understand what kind of corelations/assumptions i can make out of this data.In this part of the second phase,
i can say that i really have understood why they call it "exploratory" data analysis. I did a lot of test and since my dataset 
was very large i had quite a lot of difficulty with processing and running the codes. Even uploading here i had to put into 
two parts.

Thirdly, when it comes to hypothesis testing, i have answered some of my questions for example i know for sure that
there is a corelation between years and the bt_score. After some years the increase is inevitable to see in the gaphs. The null hypothesis
that said there is a corelation between years-bt_score is right. 

For the next step, i will dig more deeper to understanding the corelations that support my hypothesis.
